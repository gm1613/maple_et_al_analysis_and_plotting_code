# FLC_intron1_model_fitting
Python and R code and associated data files used to perform data analysis, model parameter inference, and creating plots for figures in Maple et al., 2025. Primer tables are also included.

FLC_mRNA_ActD_Decay_Exp2_Dataset.xlsx.zip contains an Excel file that includes the mRNA counts per unit area for FLC, obtained from analysis of the smFISH images as described in the Methods section of the paper.

The Jupyter notebooks provided can be used to generate the following plots presented in the paper:  

Figures 1, S2, S12: spliced_unspliced_analysis.ipynb  

Figure 2: FLC_mRNA_decay_rates.ipynb  (Note: FLC_mRNA_ActD_Decay_Exp2_Dataset.xlsx.zip must be unzipped to be used by FLC_mRNA_decay_rates.ipynb)

Figure 3, S5: maple_et_al_plaNETseq_script.Rmd (Note: The necessary .bed files must be prepared first)

Figure 4, S6-S11: flc_intron1_model_parameter_inference.ipynb
